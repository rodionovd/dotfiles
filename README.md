# My dotfiles

In this repo are my common dotfiles for all the stuff I use everyday.
Feel free to copy-paste something.


### Install

As simple as that:

```bash
# (optional, if you need git)
# xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/rodionovd/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
(cd ~/.dotfiles && ./bootstrap)
```
